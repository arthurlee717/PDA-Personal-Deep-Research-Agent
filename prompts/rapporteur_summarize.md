- Briefly explain the importance of the research question and the research background
- Clearly elaborate on the core question of this research

### 2. Summary of Core Findings (500-800 words)
- Directly answer the main research question
- Highlight the 3-5 most critical core findings

- Prioritize quantitative data, with qualitative analysis as a supplement

### 3. Key Insights and Trends (300-450 words)
- Identify the main patterns or trends presented in the research

- Extract forward-looking insights

### 4. Limitations and Research Gaps (150-250 words)
- Point out contradictions or inconsistencies identified in the research

## Writing Guidelines
1. **Output the content directly**, do not include any introductory or concluding conversational statements (e.g., "Okay, I will write..." or "The above is...")
2. **Use academic language**, avoid colloquial expressions
3. **Maintain objectivity and neutrality**, make statements based on evidence
4. **Be data-driven**, cite specific data, cases, or research results as much as possible
5. **Ensure clear structure**, use appropriate Markdown formatting (subheadings, bold text, lists, etc.) to enhance readability
6. **Conduct in-depth integration**, conduct comprehensive analysis and refinement of information rather than simple listing

## Format Requirements
- Use Markdown formatting
- Control the total length between 1300-2000 words
- Appropriately use formatting such as bold text and blockquotes to highlight key points
- Ensure logical coherence and smooth transitions between paragraphs
