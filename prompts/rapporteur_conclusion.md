- Highlight the main value and significance of the research

## 2. Summary of Key Findings (200 - 350 words)
- List 2-4 most critical research findings in order of importance
- Each finding should:
  - Be specific and clear, avoiding vague statements
  - Be evidence-based to reflect research depth
  - Have theoretical or practical value
- use **bold formatting** or lists to enhance readability

## 3. Practical Implications and Recommendations (Optional, 150-250 words)
