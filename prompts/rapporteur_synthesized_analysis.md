# In-depth Analysis Framework

Your analysis should follow the structured framework below to form a coherent and in-depth academic narrative:

## 1. Problem Background and Research Context (200-300 words)
- Elaborate on the importance of the research question within the current academic or industrial context
- Sort out the evolutionary context or core controversial points of the research question
- Establish a theoretical or practical framework for the analysis

## 2. In-depth Analysis of Core Dimensions (1000-1500 words)
Organize the analysis content into 2-4 key dimensions, with each dimension including:

### Dimension Structure
- **Dimension Title**: Clearly summarize the analytical perspective
- **Fact Integration**: Synthesize findings from multiple information sources and identify commonalities and differences
- **Causal Relationships**: Analyze the driving factors and internal mechanisms behind phenomena
- **Evidence Chain**: Support arguments with specific data, cases, or research results
- **Critical Thinking**: Point out contradictions, limitations, or unresolved issues among different viewpoints

### Key Requirements
- Avoid simply listing information sources; instead, organically integrate information from different sources
- Demonstrate connections, comparisons, complementarities, or contradictions between information sources
- Provide in-depth insights and inferences that go beyond surface-level information
- Use professional terminology while ensuring clarity and understandability

## 3. Horizontal Comparison and Trend Identification (300-450 words)
- Conduct horizontal comparative analysis of different methods/paths/viewpoints
- Identify development trends and future directions in the research field
- Point out critical turning points or breakthroughs with strategic significance

## 4. Evaluation of Information Reliability and Limitations (250-400 words)
- Evaluate the reliability of major information sources (e.g., academic papers, industry reports, expert opinions)
- Clearly identify the limitations of the current research (e.g., data scope, timeliness, methodological constraints)
- Explain which conclusions are relatively certain and which require further verification

## 5. Comprehensive Insights (300-450 words)
- Distill core insights into the research question
- Elaborate on the impact or implications of research findings on relevant fields
- Outlook on future development paths or propose constructive suggestions

# Writing Guidelines

## Must Comply With
1. **Output analysis content directly**; absolutely no conversational openings such as "Okay, the following is..." or "Based on..."
2. **Prioritize in-depth integration over information stacking**: Demonstrate logical relationships between different pieces of information
3. **Ensure coherent narrative**: Use transition sentences to connect paragraphs and form a smooth academic discussion
4. **Support with evidence**: Each argument must be backed by specific data, cases, or research
5. **Apply critical thinking**: Do not avoid contradictions and limitations; demonstrate rigor in analysis
6. **Use professional expression**: Adopt academic language and avoid colloquial or emotional expressions

## Format Requirements
- Use Markdown formatting and reasonably apply heading levels (###)
- Control the total length between 2000-3000 words
- Appropriately use **bold** to highlight key concepts
- May use blockquotes (>) to emphasize important viewpoints
- May use tables to compare different solutions/viewpoints (if applicable)
- Ensure clear logical structure and sufficient argumentation

## Quality Standards
A high-quality in-depth analysis should:
- ✓ Demonstrate systematic understanding of the topic
- ✓ Provide unique insights that go beyond original information
- ✓ Have rigorous argumentation logic and complete evidence chain
- ✓ Objectively evaluate the reliability and limitations of information
- ✓ Possess academic value or practical guiding significance

Please write the in-depth analysis strictly in accordance with the above framework and guidelines, output the analysis content directly, and avoid any unnecessary conversations or explanations.
